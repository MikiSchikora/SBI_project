dslf_fa13                                  Disulfide geometry potential.  Supports D- and L-cysteine disulfides, plus homocysteine disulfides or disulfides involving beta-3-cysteine.
rama                                       Ramachandran preferences.  Supports only the 20 canonical alpha-amino acids and their mirror images.
omega                                      Omega dihedral in the backbone. A Harmonic constraint on planarity with standard deviation of ~6 deg.  Supports alpha-amino acids, beta-amino acids, and oligoureas.  In the case of oligoureas, both amide bonds (called 'mu' and 'omega' in Rosetta) are constarined to planarity.
fa_dun                                     Internal energy of sidechain rotamers as derived from Dunbrack's statistics (2010 Rotamer Library used in Talaris2013).  Supports any residue type for which a rotamer library is avalable.
p_aa_pp                                    Probability of amino acid at Φ/Ψ.  Supports only the 20 canonical alpha-amino acids and their mirror images.

ref                                        Reference energy for each amino acid. Balances internal energy of amino acid terms.  Plays role in design.  Supports only the 20 canonical alpha-amino acids and their mirror images.
rama_prepro                                Backbone torsion preference term that takes into account of whether preceding amono acid is Proline or not.  Currently supports the 20 canonical alpha-amino acids, their mirror-image D-amino acids, oligoureas, and N-methyl amino acids.  Arbitrary new building-blocks can also be supported provided that an N-dimensional mainchain potential can be generated somehow.
